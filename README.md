# Machine Learning Forecasting of Hot Water Demand

Supplying hot water at lower cost, with less energy, and lighter load on the network infrastructure is always a primary goal of utility stakeholders. Short-term hot water demand forecasts can be taken to tackle the imbalance and gaps between supply and demand. It can be used to better schedule operations, maintenance and to provide better services. Electric water heaters or geysers account for almost half of household energy, especially during peak hours. 

The objective of this project is to forecast the volume of hot water drawn from a geyser using the sensor measurements from pre-installed geysers as the underlying data. Creating a robust model capable of accurately forecasting the demand for hot water can be used to save electricity by drawing power during off-peak hours while still ensuring hot water is available when needed.
